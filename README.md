# Movie Data Visualization

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries. It aims to explore and visualize a subset of a movie dataset with information on movie ratings, budget, and revenue. The visualizations provide insights into the distribution of ratings and the relationship between movie budget and revenue.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`) for analyzing and visualizing a movie dataset. The dataset contains columns such as movie ratings, budget, revenue, and other movie-related attributes.

The project focuses on:

* **Visualizing the distribution of movie ratings**
* **Exploring the relationship between movie budget and revenue**

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can also use a virtual environment for dependency management. The following instructions will guide you through the setup process.

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-data-visualization.git
   cd movie-data-visualization
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Make sure you have a dataset in the `movies 1.csv` file format, or update the script to point to your dataset file.

## Usage

### Visualizing Movie Ratings Distribution

The script provides a histogram and kernel density estimate (KDE) to visualize the distribution of movie ratings. Here's how to run it:

1. Place your dataset (`movies 1.csv`) in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python visualize_movies.py
   ```

   The script will:

   * Load the first 1000 rows of the dataset (or adjust based on memory).
   * Check for the correct column name for movie ratings and visualize its distribution.

### Visualizing Budget vs. Revenue Scatter Plot

The script also generates a scatter plot to explore the relationship between a movie's budget and its revenue. Here's how the process works:

1. The script will check if the columns `budget` and `revenue` exist.
2. If they do, it will plot the scatter plot with the budget on the x-axis and revenue on the y-axis.
3. If the columns do not exist, the script will fall back to other available columns (e.g., `movieId`, `genres`).

## Visualizations

### 1. **Distribution of Movie Ratings**

The script creates a histogram and KDE plot to visualize the distribution of movie ratings in the dataset. The distribution helps us understand how ratings are spread across movies, whether it's skewed, and if there are any peaks or outliers.

**Example:**

* If the rating scale is from 1 to 10, the plot will show how many movies fall within each rating range.

### 2. **Budget vs. Revenue Scatter Plot**

This scatter plot visualizes the correlation between a movie's budget and its revenue. It provides a simple way to observe how budget might influence a movie's financial success. Movies with higher budgets might generally yield higher revenues, but the plot can reveal whether this is always the case.

**Example:**

* A movie with a lower budget but a very high revenue might indicate an unexpected box office hit, which could be an interesting outlier.

## Example Output

### Movie Ratings Distribution

A histogram and KDE plot displaying the frequency distribution of movie ratings. The x-axis shows the movie ratings (e.g., 1 to 10), and the y-axis shows how many movies fall within each rating range.

### Budget vs. Revenue Scatter Plot

A scatter plot that shows the correlation between the movie budget (x-axis) and the revenue (y-axis). Points will represent individual movies, and the overall trend can indicate whether movies with larger budgets tend to generate more revenue.
